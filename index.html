        I move to Seattle over 10 years ago and started working in the restaurant business, for the last 5 years I been working in a famous place in the waterfront of the city and every day, I meet a lot of people from many different countries.
        I love football, Seattle is a big sports city and it is really hard not to pat attention to the  home team, specially in game day. I also like to play video games almost every night and work in my computer. One one my goals in life is to learn how to code, for couple of years I have hear about CodeFellows and so far, I am amaze with the program and what I have learn so far, I feel happy about the decision I made and Iâ€™m doing my best to succeed for a better future for me and my family.
